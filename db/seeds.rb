# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# Product.create("brand"=>"Samsung", "model_num"=>"S7", "price"=>"75000.0", "num_of_pieces"=>"200", "color"=>"Golden", "mfg_date"=>"2015-01-01", "image"=>"s7_golden.jpg")
