# **Inventory Management**
As a online shopping freak, I always wanted to create an e-commerce website.
This is my Project One on **Inventory Management** as part of my Web Development Immersive 15 with General Assembly.

## Duration:
4 days

## Tech Stack:
- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS
- jQuery
- Ruby
- Rails
- Cloudinary
- SendGrid
- Heroku
- Stripe
- Money-rails
- twitter, facebook, bcrypt gems

## Features:

#### Browse the site as guest.
#### Create an account for new user.
#### Login for an existing user.
#### You can browse the site, but to place an order you must login in.
#### Check all your orders with their last updated status, and check the lineitems as well.
#### Once the order is placed, admin can either Approve or Reject the order.
#### The quantity in the warehouse is updated after 'approving' the order.
#### Customizable curencies to display the price of the products. Currently displaying the price as per the preferred currency mentioned in the user's profile.
#### Delete the existing account, if user wishes to:
This will just inactivate the account


## Nice to have:
Below listed are the features I would like to implement further to this:
- Full fledged payment feature -- DONE
- Conversion of currency based on user preference -- DONE
- Password reset via mailer
- Order tracking in detail
- GeoCoder, to track location of users
- Give an option for the payment type, i.e. Cash/Credit/Debit
- Code refactoring: The code looks bulky. Could be improved
