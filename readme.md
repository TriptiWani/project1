# **Inventory Management**
This is my Project One on **Inventory Management** as part of my Web Development Immersive 15 with General Assembly.

## Duration:
4 days

## Tech Stack:
- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS
- jQuery
- Ruby
- Rails
- Cloudinary
- SendGrid
- Heroku

## Features:

### Pick Avtar:
The human players get an opportunity to choose avtar based on the mood from the below options:
- Drink Smiley
- Eat Smiley
- Tick
- Cross
- Lips
- Moustache
- Tom
- Jerry

If the player does not wish to choose an avtar, then by default *Green* and *Blue* themes will be selected.

### New/Continue:
The players have an option to 'Continue' the current game or start a 'New' game as per their wish.

### Score:
The scores of both the players are displayed on the 'Score Board'

## Nice to have:
Below listed are the features I would like to implement further to this:
- Full fledged payment feature
- Conversion of currency based on user preference
- Password reset via mailer
- GeoCoder, to track location of users
- Order tracking in detail
- Code refactoring: The code looks bulky. Could be improved
