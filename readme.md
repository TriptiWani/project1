# **Inventory Management**
This is my Project One on **Inventory Management** as part of my Web Development Immersive 15 with General Assembly.

## Duration:
4 days

## Tech Stack:
- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS
- jQuery
- Ruby
- Rails
- Cloudinary
- SendGrid
- Heroku
- Stripe

## Features:

#### Browse the site as guest.
#### Create an account for new user.
#### Login for an existing user.
#### You can browse the site, but to place an order you must login in.
#### Check all your orders with their last updated status, and check the lineitems as well.
#### Once the order is placed, admin can either Approve or Reject the order.
#### The quantity in the warehouse is updated after 'approving' the order.
#### Delete the existing account, if user wishes to:
This will just inactivate the account


## Nice to have:
Below listed are the features I would like to implement further to this:
- Full fledged payment feature
- Conversion of currency based on user preference
- Password reset via mailer
- GeoCoder, to track location of users
- Order tracking in detail
- Code refactoring: The code looks bulky. Could be improved
